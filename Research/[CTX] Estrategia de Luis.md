# B2B2C University Partnership Strategy
## Alternative Distribution Model - Peru Education Product

**Created:** November 2025
**Context:** Exploring university partnerships as primary distribution channel (vs direct B2C)
**Decision:** Should we pivot from direct-to-student sales to university partnerships?

---

## THE STRATEGIC QUESTION

**Current Approach (from EXECUTIVE-BRIEF.md):**
- Direct B2C sales to students/parents
- Target: 20-23 year olds (final year university + recent grads)
- Price: 700 soles Early Bird / 1,000 soles regular
- Distribution: Ads (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) + organic (university career center referrals)

**Alternative Approach (This Document):**
- B2B2C via universidad partnerships as PRIMARY channel
- Target: Same audience (20-23) but accessed THROUGH universities
- Price: B2B pricing (universidad pays per student OR revenue share model)
- Distribution: Universidad career centers promote/mandate/subsidize program

---

## WHY NEXT COLOMBIA USES SCHOOLS (B2B2C Model)

### Key Insights from Next's School Model:

1. **Demand Aggregation**
   - 1 partnership conversation = 50-500 students
   - vs. 500 individual marketing conversations to parents
   - School director becomes single decision gatekeeper

2. **Trust & Credibility Shortcut**
   - School endorsement = instant trust with parents
   - Removes skepticism of "random online program"
   - Parents think: "If school recommends it, must be valuable"

3. **Price Barrier Removal**
   - School pays from institutional budget
   - OR school subsidizes (student pays partial)
   - Parents don't feel full price impact

4. **Solves Motivation Problem (for 14-17 age group)**
   - Teenagers don't self-identify as having problem
   - School can mandate or strongly recommend
   - Built-in accountability (dropout prevention)

5. **CAC Near Zero**
   - No expensive Instagram/TikTok ads needed
   - No individual lead generation
   - One B2B sale = hundreds of students

6. **Dropout Prevention**
   - School structure = accountability
   - vs. 40-80% dropout rate for standalone online courses

## PERU CONTEXT: Universidad Partnership Advantages

### Why University Partnerships Make Sense for Peru (20-23 Age Group):

#### **1. Mid-Tier Universities Have Placement Gap (Validated Pain Point)**

**From Research (education-product-critical-assessment.md):**
- "85% job placement within 6 months from TOP universities (PUCP, San Marcos)"
- Mid-tier universities lack comprehensive career services
- Graduate employment outcomes significantly lower

**Universidad Pain Point:**
- Their graduates struggle vs PUCP/San Marcos peers
- Reflects poorly on institution quality
- Parents/students choosing universities based on placement rates

**Your Solution:**
- Program that improves graduate placement outcomes
- Universidad can market: "Our partnership with [Program] increased placement rate 40%"
- Differentiation vs competing universities

---

#### **2. Price Barrier for Emerging Middle Class (Critical Challenge)**

**From Research:**
- 1,000 soles = 20-25% of monthly household income (2,000-2,500 soles/month)
- Competing with school fees, English courses, family necessities
- High price resistance unless ROI is IMMEDIATELY clear

**Universidad Partnership Solution:**

**Option A: Universidad Pays (Fully Subsidized)**
- Universidad budgets 500-700 soles per student
- Students access program for free (or nominal fee like 200 soles)
- Universidad markets as "career prep included in your tuition/services"

**Option B: Co-Pay Model (Partially Subsidized)**
- Universidad pays 400 soles per student
- Student/parent pays 300 soles (70% discount)
- Psychologically easier: 300 soles vs 1,000 soles

**Option C: Revenue Share (Universidad as Affiliate)**
- Student pays 700-1,000 soles
- Universidad gets 20-30% commission for promotion/endorsement
- Universidad career center actively promotes program

---

#### **3. Credibility & Trust (Critical for Conversion)**

**Challenge with Direct B2C:**
- New brand (no Prisma association Year 1)
- No testimonials initially
- Parents skeptical: "Another online course promising employment?"

**Universidad Partnership Advantage:**
- Universidad endorsement = instant credibility
- "Recommended by your university career center" > random Instagram ad
- Students think: "If my university partnered with them, must be legitimate"

---

#### **4. Demand Aggregation (Operational Efficiency)**

**Direct B2C Challenge:**
- Need to enroll 100-150 students for Cohort 1
- Scattered across Lima (different universities, different neighborhoods)
- Expensive: CAC estimated <200 soles/student (but risky if conversion low)

**Universidad Partnership Advantage:**
- 1 partnership = 20-30 students (captive audience)
- 5 universidad partnerships = 100-150 students (target achieved)
- Lower CAC: Negotiation with 5 decision-makers vs marketing to 150 individuals

**Example:**
- Universidad UTEC (final year business students): 25 students
- Universidad UTP (final year admin students): 30 students
- Universidad de Lima: 25 students
- Universidad San Ignacio: 20 students
- Universidad Peruana de Ciencias: 20 students
- **Total: 120 students across 5 partnerships**

---

#### **5. Outcomes Data & Continuous Improvement**

**Universidad Partnership Advantage:**
- Universities ALREADY track graduate employment (for accreditation, marketing)
- You can integrate with their tracking systems
- Clear attribution: "Students who completed [Program] have 40% higher placement rate"
- Creates data flywheel: Better outcomes → Universidad promotes more → More students → More data

**Direct B2C Challenge:**
- You need to track outcomes yourself (survey fatigue, low response rates)
- Harder to validate claims without institutional backing

| Dimension | Direct B2C (Current Plan) | B2B2C Universidad Partnerships |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Target Customer** | Student/parent (decision maker) | Universidad career center (gatekeeper) + student |
| **Price Point** | 700-1,000 soles (student pays full) | 300-700 soles (co-pay or subsidized) |
| **CAC (Cost/Student)** | <200 soles (ads, marketing) | ~50-100 soles (B2B sales effort) |
| **Trust/Credibility** | ⚠️ New brand, no testimonials | ✅ Universidad endorsement |
| **Price Resistance** | ⚠️ High (1,000 soles = 20-25% income) | ✅ Lower (subsidized or co-pay) |
| **Enrollment Effort** | ❌ 150 individual conversions | ✅ 5 B2B partnerships |
| **Dropout Risk** | ⚠️ Moderate-High (40-60%) | ✅ Lower (universidad accountability) |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Linear (ad spend dependent) | ✅ Linear (partnership by partnership) |
| **Data/Outcomes** | ⚠️ Self-reported (low reliability) | ✅ Universidad tracks (high reliability) |
| **Control** | ✅ Full control (brand, curriculum, pricing) | ⚠️ Shared (universidad input required) |
| **Time to First Revenue** | ⚠️ 2-3 months (build audience) | ✅ 1-2 months (B2B sales faster) |
| **Defensibility** | ⚠️ Low (competitors can copy) | ✅ High (exclusive partnerships) |
| **Revenue per Student** | ✅ Higher (700-1,000 soles) | ⚠️ Lower (300-500 soles after universidad cut) |
| **Total Addressable Market** | ✅ Larger (all students in Peru) | ⚠️ Smaller (limited by universidad partnerships) |

## FINANCIAL MODEL COMPARISON

### **Scenario A: Pure B2C (Current Plan)**

**Revenue (Cohort 1 - 100 students):**
- 100 students x 700 soles = 70,000 soles

**Costs:**
- Marketing/CAC: 100 students x 200 soles = 20,000 soles
- Executive compensation: 6,000 soles
- Platform/operations: 5,000 soles
- Team salaries: 15,000 soles
- **Total Costs:** 46,000 soles

**Net Profit:** 24,000 soles (34% margin)

---

### **Scenario B: B2B2C Universidad Partnerships (Alternative)**

**Revenue (Cohort 1 - 100 students across 5 universities):**
- 100 students x 500 soles average (mix of models) = 50,000 soles

**Costs:**
- Marketing/CAC: 5 universities x 2,000 soles (B2B sales effort) = 10,000 soles
- Executive compensation: 6,000 soles
- Platform/operations: 5,000 soles
- Team salaries: 15,000 soles
- **Total Costs:** 36,000 soles

**Net Profit:** 14,000 soles (28% margin)

---

### **Scenario C: Hybrid (Recommended)**

**Revenue (Cohort 1 - 100 students):**
- 70 students via universidad partnerships x 500 soles = 35,000 soles
- 30 students direct B2C x 700 soles = 21,000 soles
- **Total Revenue:** 56,000 soles

**Costs:**
- Marketing/CAC: (5 universities x 2,000) + (30 students x 150 soles) = 14,500 soles
- Executive compensation: 6,000 soles
- Platform/operations: 5,000 soles
- Team salaries: 15,000 soles
- **Total Costs:** 40,500 soles

| **Risk Level** | ⚠️ High | ✅ Low | ✅ Medium |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Ad-dependent | ✅ Partnership-driven | ✅ Diversified |
| **Defensibility** | ❌ Low | ✅ High (partnerships) | ✅ Medium |

**Key Insight:**
- Pure B2C has highest margin BUT highest risk (CAC uncertainty, price resistance)
- Pure B2B2C has lower revenue/student BUT much lower risk (guaranteed enrollment)
- **Hybrid balances both**: Partnerships de-risk Cohort 1, B2C provides upside

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### **Choose Pure B2C IF:**
- ✅ You have budget for 20,000+ soles CAC spend (high risk tolerance)
- ✅ You're confident 700-1,000 soles pricing will convert at 5-10%
- ✅ You want maximum control (no universidad input on curriculum)
- ✅ You can tolerate low enrollment Cohort 1 (50-75 students acceptable)

### **Choose Pure B2B2C (Universidad Partnerships) IF:**
- ✅ You want guaranteed enrollment (100+ students confirmed before launch)
- ✅ You want instant credibility (universidad endorsement)
- ✅ You're willing to accept lower revenue/student (500 vs 1,000 soles)
- ✅ You can build relationships with universidad decision-makers

### **Choose HYBRID (Recommended) IF:**
- ✅ You want to de-risk Cohort 1 with partnerships WHILE testing direct B2C
- ✅ You're not certain which model works best (test both simultaneously)
- ✅ You want diversified distribution (not dependent on single channel)
- ✅ You're comfortable with blended revenue/student (560 soles average)

- [ ] Are you willing to give universidad input on curriculum?
- [ ] Can you handle universidad branding requirements (co-branding)?
- [ ] Are you OK with universidad seeing your content/materials?

**4. Scalability Vision:**
- [ ] Do you want to scale via partnerships (institutional) or brand (consumer)?
- [ ] Is building universidad relationships strategic long-term asset?
- [ ] Or do you prefer direct consumer brand you control 100%?

---

## RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

### **My Honest Assessment:**

**For Cohort 1 (March 2026): HYBRID MODEL**

**Why:**
- ✅ De-risks enrollment (partnerships guarantee 60-80% of target)
- ✅ Tests both channels (learn which works better for Cohort 2+)
- ✅ Builds universidad relationships (defensible asset)
- ✅ Provides direct B2C data (for future pure consumer play if partnerships don't scale)

**Primary Focus: Universidad Partnerships (70%)**
- Target: 3-5 universidad partnerships (60-80 students)
- Pitch November-December 2025
- Close partnerships by January 2026

**Secondary Focus: Direct B2C (30%)**
- Target: 20-40 students direct
- Launch landing page mid-December
- Fill remaining spots after universidad commitments secured

**Long-Term (Year 2-3):**
- IF universidad partnerships work well (high completion, good outcomes) → Scale B2B2C
- IF direct B2C converts better and provides higher margin → Pivot to consumer
- Most likely: Continue hybrid with 60-40 or 50-50 split
